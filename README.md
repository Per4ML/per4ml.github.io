### Static Site Generation
Static html files are generated from `./contents/blank.html`
using information in respective `./contents/`

Static file generation can be accomplished by using the `./mkhtml.py` script

*For normal updates (git push),
generation is automated in `./.github/workflows/deploy.yml`*
___
### Content Files
Files within `./contents/` contain information to create `*.html` files

Content filenames are the corresponding `*.html` file's prefix,
and include example usage

Except for `index`,
a file should exist (even if empty) for each `*.html` file to be generated

*Follow usage of examples or other entries*

*Files are parsed by `mkhtml.py`
